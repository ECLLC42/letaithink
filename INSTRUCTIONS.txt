I’ll lay out a step‑by‑step, ontology-first plan to combine OpenAI’s Agents SDK with Arcade’s tools, plus minimal glue code. No code changes yet—pure design you can implement next.
1) Capabilities ontology (what must be possible)
• Research: web search/scrape, social signals (optional: LinkedIn/X read).
• Repo/CI: create repo, branches, PRs, trigger CI, fetch artifacts.
• Deploy: provision staging/prod, env vars, rollbacks, health checks.
• Database: create DB, migrations, seed, rotate secrets.
• QA: run E2E (Playwright) and perf checks.
• Comms: send updates via Slack/Email; calendar scheduling.
• Content: generate README/landing/blog.
2) Tool ontology (how agents act)
• Arcade toolkits (user-consented, secure): github, google (Gmail/Drive/Calendar), slack, plus any deploy provider toolkits you enable (e.g., vercel, render, fly if/when available).
• Internal tools: web search/scrape, vector search, repo scaffolder, cost meter, risk/PII checks.
• Policies: tool scopes per role; approval gates for destructive actions (delete/rollback).
3) Agent ontology (who does what)
• Orchestrator: plans DAG, assigns handoffs, enforces budget and approvals.
• Researcher: market scan; uses internal web tools; optional social APIs via Arcade.
• Architect: design/data model/stack; no external tools by default.
• Coder: github toolkit; file ops via PRs; seeds CI config.
• QA: triggers CI/E2E; reads artifacts; blocks on failures.
• Publisher: deploy toolkit; sets env, rollbacks, post-deploy checks.
• Marketer: gmail/slack and content tools for assets and notifications.
4) State ontology (what persists)
• projects: name, prefs, repo_url, envs.
• sessions: transcript, constraints, budget caps.
• runs: agent, status, costs, trace_id, tool_calls.
• artifacts: code/doc/report with storage ref.
• handoffs: from/to, reason, payload.
• tools: name, scopes, audit trail.
• Vector memory for artifacts and prior decisions.
5) Consent and identity ontology
• System user_id: stable ID per end-user (email/UUID).
• Linking: first tool use returns auth-needed; surface Arcade’s authorize URL; on success, Arcade stores provider tokens scoped to that user_id.
• Least privilege: per-toolkit scopes; elevate only when required and approved.
6) Orchestration ontology (plan/DAG)
• Phases: Intake → Research (parallel) → Architecture → Build (PRs) → QA (gate) → Deploy (gate) → Marketing → Summary.
• Parallelizable nodes: competitor scans, repo scaffold vs content prep, etc.
• Gates: QA green required before Deploy; Deploy green before Marketing outreach.
7) Execution model (Agents SDK + Arcade)
• One agent per role; Orchestrator coordinates multi-step runs and handoffs.
• Each agent gets only the tools it needs (principle of least privilege).
• Pass context={"user_id": "<system_user_id>"} so Arcade authorizes per user.
• Handle AuthorizationError by emitting an authorization link to your UI and retrying post-consent.


8) Minimal wiring (Python)

# pip install agents-arcade arcadepy
import os, asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError

async def main():
    client = AsyncArcade(api_key=os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"])

    github_tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["github"])
    gmail_tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, toolkits=["google"])  # Gmail/Drive/Calendar

    coder = Agent(
        name="Coder",
        instructions="Scaffold repo, open PRs, wire CI/migrations.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=github_tools,
    )
    marketer = Agent(
        name="Marketer",
        instructions="Draft landing and email updates.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=gmail_tools,
    )

    try:
        r1 = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent= coder,
            input="Create a new repo 'runner-habits' with Next.js + FastAPI skeleton, open PR.",
            context={"user_id": "user-123"},
        )
        r2 = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent= marketer,
            input=f"Email me a launch blurb referencing repo link: {r1.final_output}",
            context={"user_id": "user-123"},
        )
        print(r2.final_output)
    except AuthorizationError as e:
        # Show e.authorize_url in your UI; ask user to connect provider, then retry.
        print("Authorization required:", e)
asyncio.run(main())

9) Minimal wiring (TS)

// npm i @arcadeai/arcadejs
import Arcade from "@arcadeai/arcadejs";
import { executeOrAuthorizeZodTool, toZod } from "@arcadeai/arcadejs/lib";
import { Agent, run, tool } from "@openai/agents";

const client = new Arcade({ apiKey: process.env.ARCADE_API_KEY! });

const gh = await client.tools.list({ toolkit: "github", limit: 30 });
const githubTools = toZod({
  tools: gh.items, client, userId: "user-123", executeFactory: executeOrAuthorizeZodTool,
}).map(tool);

const coder = new Agent({
  name: "Coder",
  instructions: "Create repo and bootstrap CI.",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  tools: githubTools,
});

const result = await run(coder, "Create repo 'runner-habits' and open a PR.");
console.log(result.finalOutput); // If auth needed, surface authorization and retry

10) Guardrails ontology
• Validation: schema-check idea/constraints; reject risky inputs.
• Approvals: two-step “plan → confirm → execute” for destructive ops (delete, revoke, external posts).
• Budgets: per-session token/cost caps, per-tool usage throttles.
• Safety: PII scanner before externalization; block outbound if failing.
• Rollbacks: on failed post-deploy checks, auto-rollback and notify.
11) Memory ontology
• Short-term: current plan, pending approvals, partial artifacts (in run context).
• Long-term: per-project decisions, repo URLs, deployment endpoints.
• Vector store: chunks of code/doc artifacts for grounding subsequent steps.
12) Persistence and queues
• DB tables per your schema (projects, sessions, runs, artifacts, handoffs, tools).
• Worker pool (Celery/RQ) executes long-running tool calls; store trace_id and Arcade call IDs.
• Idempotent retries on transient provider failures; exponential backoff.
13) Observability and audit
• Use Agents SDK tracing + OpenTelemetry; tag spans with project_id, run_id, user_id.
• Persist Arcade tool-call metadata for audit; surface in a “Tool History” panel.
• Redaction on logs for inputs/outputs with PII markers.
14) Evaluation and CI
• Unit tests for each internal tool; mocked Arcade calls for CI.
• Scenario evals (Arcade evaluation framework) for end-to-end flows: repo scaffold → CI green → deploy → notify.
• Quality gates: must-pass evals before production deploy.
15) UX integration
• “Connect accounts” drawer listing needed providers (GitHub, Google, Slack).
• Real-time plan/progress/artifacts panes; approvals as inline actions.
• Errors that require consent clearly show provider and scopes before re-run.
16) Mapping journey → tools
• Research: internal search, optional Arcade google for Drive/Calendar if needed.
• MVP/Arch: pure LLM + internal validators.
• Scaffold/CI: Arcade github.
• DB: deploy toolkit + secrets manager; migrations via CI job.
• Deploy: Arcade vercel/render/fly (as available) + health checks.
• QA: CI tools + test artifacts.
• Marketing: Arcade google (Gmail), slack; optional linkedin/x.
17) Practical naming and packages
• Python: agents-arcade (import agents_arcade), arcadepy client.
• JavaScript: @arcadeai/arcadejs.
• OpenAI Agents SDK: agents (Python) or @openai/agents (TS).
18) Failure/edge handling
• Missing consent: catch AuthorizationError, present link, persist “needs-auth,” retry after callback.
• Rate limits: central backoff policy; queue spillover.
• Partial success: Orchestrator resumes DAG from last good node.
With this ontology, you can wire each agent to just the Arcade toolkits it needs, run gated plans via the Agents SDK, and rely on Arcade to handle per-user auth and audit while your app persists state, memory, and artifacts.
Built a stepwise ontology for capabilities, tools, agents, state, consent, orchestration, guardrails, memory, queues, observability, and evals. Included minimal Python/TS wiring snippets for OpenAI Agents SDK with agents-arcade/arcadepy to show consent, tool scoping, and per-user execution.
